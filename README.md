File Surgery: Open, Merge, Discharge!

open the files, merge the insides, discharge the original files!

mergeMD: take for instance 2 alike in name markdown files -> delete data from 1 merge into 1 new .md file
surgery: open, merge, discharge 

bookmarking that I originally wanted to set this up for 2 files that have the same name. Instead:
fgets() || scanf() to retrieve the name of the first markdown file.
^           ^           ^         ^         ^         ^         ^       

the above same step gets repeated to gather the data from a second file that is specified by input.

 The project will now allow for the specification of which file to open. This new development kind of steps over the pun of markdown file MD doctor
I like the idea of being able to do the same for a .txt file and now that I'm typing this, perhaps even combining C code.

To do
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if a user were to type into the input, a file which was not within scope of their desktop, print the files, show user, goto: redo input []
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// bookmark that a file combiner: interesting and probably not too out of reach project for a: **first android mobile project**
// utility should be able to combine text from md into text file and choose which lasting file to hold onto.
