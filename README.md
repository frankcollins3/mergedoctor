mergeMD: take for instance 2 alike in name markdown files -> delete data from 1 merge into 1 new .md file

bookmarking that I originally wanted to set this up for 2 files that have the same name. Instead:
fgets() || scanf() to retrieve the name of the first markdown file.
^           ^           ^         ^         ^         ^         ^       
the above same step gets repeated to gather the data from a second file that is specified by input.
