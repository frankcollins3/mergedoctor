open the files, merge the insides, discharge the original files!

mergeMD: take for instance 2 alike in name markdown files -> delete data from 1 merge into 1 new .md file

the above same step gets repeated to gather the data from a second file that is specified by input.

 The project will now allow for the specification of which file to open. This new development kind of steps over the pun of markdown file MD doctor
